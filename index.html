        <p class="para">We are a small business that sells stuff to be upcycled. Sometimes finding materials 
            can be difficult, or you need an oddly specific piece for your next project. Hopefully 
            some of these products will be exactly what you need. We have a variety of items. If 
            you find something you like, be quick to get it! There is a limited stock on everything, 
            so once it's gone, it's gone for good. If you have any questions, you can contact us 
            here.</p>
